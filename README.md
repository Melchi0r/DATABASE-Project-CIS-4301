# DATABASE-Project-CIS-4301
Project for CIS 4301: Information and Database Systems 1:
Zip file for a project I did in my CIS-4301 class.
In this assignment I took a database and put it in a Webapp where it could be used via a front end interface. 
The database is SQlite3.
I also used express, nodeJS, html, and CSS



In this the user selects from a list of flowers where if they click on the name of the flower and scroll down to "flowers statistics"
they can see information about the various sightings of that flower. 

They can also insert their own sightings at the bottom of the page.

Under each of the flowers on the list of flowers they can update information about the flower including the genus, species and common name
of the flower.
